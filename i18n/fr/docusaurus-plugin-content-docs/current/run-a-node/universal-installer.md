# Install anywhere — the universal installer

The cross-platform path — **Windows, macOS, and any Linux**. It detects your OS, installs the `dig-node` service (Windows service / `systemd` / `launchd`) and the `digstore` CLI, and needs no package manager.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://dig.net/install.sh | sh
```

This is the same self-contained `dig-installer` shipped on the [Releases page](https://github.com/DIG-Network/dig-installer/releases) — download and run it directly if you prefer not to pipe to a shell, or on Windows.

## `dig.local`

The installer registers **`dig.local`** for your machine so consumers on the same host resolve your node by name (`dig.local` → `localhost`) without hard-coding a port. This is what lets the [DIG Browser](../browser/chia-protocol.md) and extension prefer a local node automatically. → [Point a consumer at your node](./point-a-consumer.md)

:::note Pre-release
The hosted installers (`apt.dig.net`, `dig.net/install.sh`) are still being provisioned. Until they're live, build from source or grab a binary from the [dig-node Releases](https://github.com/DIG-Network/dig-node/releases). The commands here are the real, intended ones.
:::

## On Debian-family systems

Prefer the signed, `apt upgrade`-able native path: → [Install on Ubuntu/Debian via apt](./apt.md).
