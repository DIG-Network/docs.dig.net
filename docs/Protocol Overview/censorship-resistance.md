# Censorship Resistance

### **Censorship Resistance on the DIG Network**

The DIG Network is a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) launched on the Chia Blockchain, designed to promote **data sovereignty** and the **democratization of information**. It ensures that content remains available and accessible across a globally distributed network of DIG Nodes. By reducing reliance on centralized infrastructure, the DIG Network prevents any single entity—whether a corporation, organization, or central authority—from fully controlling or blocking access to data, providing protection against censorship.

Importantly, the DIG Network is built for **responsible content distribution** and supports the availability of information in ways that comply with regional and global standards. Leveraging global diversity, incentive structures, and a dynamic peer-to-peer architecture, the DIG Network offers strong defenses against censorship and disruptions, while reducing exposure to traditional attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DOS) and DNS-based attacks.

### **The Role of Datastore Owners and Writers**

A datastore on the DIG Network is owned and managed by a central entity and its authorized writers. These parties are the only ones who can edit or update the datastore. This ensures secure content management, with responsibility for the content’s integrity. 

If only one node serves a datastore, its availability can be vulnerable to disruption or blocking. However, as more DIG Nodes mirror the datastore, the resilience of the network increases, helping ensure content remains available.

### **Mirroring for Increased Availability**

When multiple DIG Nodes mirror a datastore, the content becomes more resistant to disruption. Mirroring spreads the content across several nodes, each capable of serving the datastore. If a few nodes go offline or are forcibly shut down, the remaining nodes continue to make the content available. The more mirrors that serve the data, the greater the resilience to takedowns or disruptions.

**Decentralization** plays a key role in providing censorship resistance. By distributing content across multiple regions, the DIG Network helps prevent any single authority from blocking content without significant effort. Decentralization also provides strong protection against traditional attacks, like DOS and DNS attacks, which target centralized systems more effectively.

### **Legal and Regulatory Jurisdictions**

In **many free societies**, content that is protected by free speech laws generally remains safe from censorship. The DIG Network helps support these protections by maintaining availability and access to content. 

However, in regions where **oppressive policies** may restrict the free flow of information, the decentralized structure of the DIG Network provides critical advantages. By distributing DIG Nodes across diverse legal jurisdictions—particularly those with independent enforcement frameworks—it becomes much harder for any single authority to fully restrict access to content. 

For example, a datastore mirrored on DIG Nodes in multiple countries (e.g., the United States, Switzerland, and others) becomes far more resistant to takedown attempts than if mirrored only in one country. Even if nodes in one jurisdiction are restricted, others can continue to serve the content, ensuring it remains accessible.

### **Defense Against Data Blocking and Traditional Attacks**

The DIG Network is designed to defend against traditional methods of censorship, such as **IP blocking** and **DOS attacks**, which aim to disrupt access to content. The network offers multiple built-in defenses:

1. **The Mirror Market:** DIG Nodes dynamically mirror and unmirror datastores, creating a constantly shifting landscape. This makes it difficult for authorities or attackers to target specific nodes, as the content is always being served by different peers.
   
2. **Constant IP Shifting:** Because DIG Nodes continuously seek out profitable datastores to host, the IP addresses hosting content shift frequently, making it challenging to block content through IP blacklisting.

3. **Resilience Against DOS Attacks:** With its decentralized architecture, the DIG Network spreads the attack surface across many nodes, reducing the likelihood that a single attack can disrupt the availability of content.

This makes the DIG Network robust against both censorship and traditional attacks that often target centralized platforms.

### **Anonymity in Data Publishing**

The DIG Network enables users to **anonymously publish data**, ensuring that no central authority can easily compel the disclosure of a datastore publisher's identity. This is particularly valuable in regions where information may face unjust suppression. 

#### **Advantages of Anonymous Publishing**

While anonymity introduces challenges—such as building trust in the published data—it remains an important feature in protecting the availability of information in regions where individuals face undue risk. In many parts of the world, **code and information** are protected as free speech, allowing developers to create and share their work freely. The DIG Network enables developers to **anonymously deploy dApps**, providing them with additional protection while maintaining a level of operational independence.

### **Defense Against Payment Censorship**

DIG Nodes are incentivized to mirror datastores through payments made by sponsors (usually the datastore owner). However, payment systems themselves can become targets for censorship, potentially cutting off support for certain datastores.

#### **How Payment Censorship is Mitigated**
- **Dynamic Payment Redirection:** If a node cannot receive payments due to restrictions, it will drop out of the network, and other nodes will continue to mirror the datastore. This ensures that content continues to be served, even if some nodes are temporarily affected.
  
- **Uninterrupted Service:** Even if certain nodes are blocked from receiving payments, the network remains functional as other nodes step in to take their place, ensuring ongoing availability of content.

### **Global Distribution of Peers**

To further ensure censorship resistance, it is important to **distribute datastores** across a wide range of peers in different legal jurisdictions. By doing so, the DIG Network increases the likelihood that content will remain accessible, even if certain regions attempt to restrict access.

---

### **Incentivizing Anonymously**

The DIG Network also allows for **anonymous incentivization** of datastores. Users can farm fresh XCH on a dedicated PlotNFT and use those rewards to pay DIG Nodes to mirror their datastores without revealing personal information. This feature provides extra layers of privacy while maintaining the availability of content on the network.

### **Defense Against DNS Censorship**

The DIG Network offers protection against **DNS-based censorship**, which is often used to block centralized domain names. Unlike traditional systems, the DIG Network does not rely on DNS to locate datastores. Instead, it uses the **Chia blockchain** for peer discovery, making it more resilient to DNS-based blocking.

Even if domain names are blocked, users can still access content through the blockchain, further enhancing the network’s ability to resist censorship.

### **Using Decentralized Name Services for Enhanced Censorship Resistance**

Leveraging **decentralized name services** such as [**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**](https://ens.domains/), [**Unstoppable Domains**](https://unstoppabledomains.com/), and [**NamesDAO**](https://namesdao.org/) further enhances censorship resistance. These services allow users to map human-readable domain names to datastores on the DIG Network, providing an additional layer of protection against centralized control.

### **Conclusion: Resilience Through Decentralization**

The DIG Network’s architecture, built around decentralization, promotes **data sovereignty** and the **democratization of information**. With its reliance on distributed nodes and a peer-to-peer structure, the network is designed to ensure continuous access to information in the face of censorship attempts and traditional cyberattacks. 

By leveraging global distribution, dynamic infrastructure, and decentralized technologies, the DIG Network provides a robust platform for **open and accessible content** on the internet, ensuring that lawful content can remain resilient and accessible.
