# Future Plans

## Provably Fair Incentive Systems

We are actively researching ways to make the incentive process **provably fair**. This includes:

- **On-Chain Escrow of Funds**: Allowing Store Sponsors to escrow funds on-chain.
- **Automated Reward Claims**: Enabling DIG Nodes to claim rewards automatically by proving they provided service.
- **Transparency and Fairness**: Ensuring that payments are transparent and directly linked to the service provided.

## Multichain Expansion

Our plan includes:

- **Expansion to Major Blockchains**: Rolling out the DIG Network across all major blockchains.
- **Universal Datalayer Identifier**: Uniting content across all blockchains under a unified identification scheme.
- **Interoperability**: Offering a seamless experience for developers and users across different blockchain ecosystems.

## Tools for Node Operators

- **Content Curation Tools**: Developing tools to help DIG Node operators curate the content they wish to mirror.
- **Earning Rewards While Filtering Content**: Allowing nodes to earn rewards without compromising on the content they host.

## Community Involvement

- **Feedback and Collaboration**: We welcome community feedback on all aspects of the DIG Network.
- **Building Responsibly**: Our goal is to build a more decentralized internetâ€”not an irresponsible one.

## Commitment to Ethical Operation

As the protocol grows, we are committed to:

- **Empowering Users**: Giving individuals control over the data they consume and publish.
- **Ensuring Ethical Practices**: Implementing measures to prevent the spread of illegal or undesirable content.
- **Continual Improvement**: Evolving the protocol based on research, technology advancements, and community input.
