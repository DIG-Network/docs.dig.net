# DIG Network Vision

The DIG Network aims to become the go-to distributed content delivery system for all of Web3, across all blockchain networks. While the underlying blockchain doesn’t technically matter for the content it delivers—meaning an Ethereum dApp could be served on a DIG Network running on Solana—it’s understood that developers will want to deploy their applications within ecosystems they’re familiar with.

## Multichain at Its Core

That's why the DIG Protocol is designed to be **multichain at its core**, and with further investment, we plan to expand the Network to every major blockchain, uniting content across all of them under a **Universal Datalayer Identifier** scheme.

### Launching on Chia Network

At launch, the DIG Network will debut on the **Chia Network** blockchain. This choice is intentional, as the DIG Network is deeply influenced by Chia’s early DataLayer concept. While the DIG Network diverges from Chia’s official DataLayer in significant ways, the two systems are essentially siblings.

Reengineering the DIG Network with lessons learned from DataLayer was a natural decision, making Chia a perfect starting point. Chia will serve as the initial proving ground for testing and refining the system, with the goal of rolling it out across all major blockchains from there.

## Ambitious and Adaptable

This multichain approach ensures that the DIG Network is not only adaptable but also ambitious in scope—offering a seamless, interoperable experience for developers and users alike.
