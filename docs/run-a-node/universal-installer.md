# Install anywhere — the universal installer

The cross-platform path — **Windows, macOS, and any Linux**. It detects your OS, installs the `dig-node` service (Windows service / `systemd` / `launchd`) and the `digstore` CLI, and needs no package manager.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://dig.net/install.sh | sh
```

This is the same self-contained `dig-installer` shipped on the [Releases page](https://github.com/DIG-Network/dig-installer/releases) — download and run it directly if you prefer not to pipe to a shell, or on Windows.

## GUI installer {#gui-installer}

Prefer a guided setup over flags? Downloading and running the installer directly (instead of piping to a shell) opens a desktop wizard — **Welcome → License → Components → Install → Done** — in a dark theme that matches the rest of DIG Network's apps.

On the **Components** step, every component — `digstore`, `dig-node`, `dig-dns`, `dig-relay`, and DIG Browser — is checked by default, so clicking through with no changes installs everything (`digstore` has no checkbox; it's always installed). Uncheck any of the others to install just a subset.

If a component isn't available yet for your platform, it's skipped automatically and the rest of your selected components still install normally.

Re-running the installer over an already-installed `dig-node` or `dig-relay` — to upgrade, for example — needs no manual steps: it stops the running service, replaces the binary with the new version, then starts it again, so the service ends up in the same running or stopped state it was in before.

## `dig.local`

The installer registers **`dig.local`** for your machine so consumers on the same host resolve your node by name (`dig.local` → `localhost`) without hard-coding a port. This is what lets the [DIG Browser](../browser/chia-protocol.md) and extension prefer a local node automatically. → [Point a consumer at your node](./point-a-consumer.md)

:::note Pre-release
The hosted installers (`apt.dig.net`, `dig.net/install.sh`) are still being provisioned. Until they're live, build from source or grab a binary from the [dig-node Releases](https://github.com/DIG-Network/dig-node/releases). The commands here are the real, intended ones.
:::

## An always-on service, verified after install

`--with-dig-node` registers `dig-node` as an **auto-start** service — it comes up again after a reboot with no manual step, and starts as part of installation. On Linux and macOS it also **auto-restarts if it ever crashes** (Windows recovery-on-crash is still being wired up).

Once the service is started, the installer runs two checks and prints the result of each:

- **`dig.local` resolves** — the OS resolver actually maps `dig.local` to your node's loopback address right now (not just that the hosts entry was written).
- **Health check** — the node answers a live RPC call on its configured port (default `9778`), proving the service isn't just registered but actually serving.

```sh
dig-installer --with-dig-node
#   Registering dig-node as an OS service (port 9778):
#     ✓ dig-node installed as an OS service and started
#     ✓ dig.local: 127.0.0.2 dig.local → /etc/hosts
#     ✓ dig.local resolve check: dig.local → 127.0.0.2
#     ✓ health check: rpc.discover on http://127.0.0.1:9778/ answered
```

With the node up and verified, the [extension](../audiences/content-consumers.md) and the [DIG Browser](../browser/chia-protocol.md) find it automatically at `dig.local` (or `localhost:9778`) — no configuration needed on the consumer side. `--uninstall-dig-node` removes the service and the `dig.local` entry cleanly.

## Browse `.dig` names directly {#browse-dig-names-directly}

Add `--with-dig-dns` to also install [`dig-dns`](https://github.com/DIG-Network/dig-dns)
— a local `*.dig` name resolver — as an OS service (Windows Service / macOS
LaunchDaemon / Linux systemd):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://dig.net/install.sh | sh -s -- --with-dig-dns
```

This lets a browser open `http://<storeId>.dig/<path>` directly: dig-dns resolves the
store's chain-anchored root and serves its content from your dig-node. The installer
wires OS split-DNS (or an NRPT rule on Windows) and, as a fallback, a PAC proxy file
for browsers that bypass the OS resolver (e.g. a browser forcing DNS-over-HTTPS) —
either path alone is enough for `.dig` URLs to load. It never edits `/etc/hosts`,
never rewrites URLs, and never intercepts TLS. Run `dig-dns doctor` any time to check
which path is live and get a fix hint for what isn't.

The [extension](../audiences/content-consumers.md)'s "open a chia:// address or DIG URN"
input on its home screen detects `dig-dns` automatically: with it installed and running, opening
an address navigates straight to its real `http://<storeId>.dig/` page; without it, the same
address still opens, rendered inside the extension.

## On Debian-family systems

Prefer the signed, `apt upgrade`-able native path: → [Install on Ubuntu/Debian via apt](./apt.md).
