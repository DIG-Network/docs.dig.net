# Decentralized Live Streaming

## Peer-to-Peer Broadcasts with Permanent Access

In today’s centralized streaming landscape, live streams and podcasts can be easily taken down, blocked, or censored by platforms or governments. However, by leveraging the **DIG Network**, creators can build a **decentralized dApp** that provides a **peer-to-peer live stream** or podcast, ensuring that their broadcasts remain accessible to the world indefinitely. 

The **DIG Network** allows creators to mount their stream onto a decentralized system with a **Universal DataLayer Identifier (UDI)**, a permanent resource identifier that guarantees the stream can always be found, even as peers come and go. While the peer-to-peer streaming technology must be built into the dApp by the creator, the **DIG Network** ensures that the live stream remains accessible through the UDI, making it nearly impossible to shut down.

### How It Works: Decentralized Streaming with Permanent Access

1. **Creator Builds a Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming dApp**: The live streaming functionality must be built by the creator using a peer-to-peer (P2P) streaming architecture. This dApp serves as the frontend for the live stream or podcast and is responsible for managing the P2P transmission of the content.

2. **Mounting the Stream on the DIG Network**: Once the dApp is created, the live stream or podcast is mounted on the **DIG Network** and associated with a **Universal DataLayer Identifier (UDI)**. The UDI serves as a **permanent resource identifier**, ensuring that anyone can access the stream from this consistent location.

3. **Permanent Location for the Stream**: The DIG Network does not manage the P2P transmission itself, but by providing a **permanent UDI**, it guarantees that the stream can always be located. The UDI never changes, allowing viewers to access the live stream even if certain mirrors drop off or new mirrors take their place.

### Funding the Stream Through Viewer Tips

The dApp’s frontend can be enhanced with widgets that allow viewers to **tip** the streamer. These tips play a dual role: supporting the streamer and funding the decentralized hosting of the stream through the DIG Network’s **incentive program**.

- **Tip to Fund Hosting**: Viewers can tip using cryptocurrencies or other assets, and these funds are directed into a **DIG Incentive Program**. This program incentivizes **DIG Nodes** to host and propagate the stream’s data, ensuring it stays accessible across the world.

- **Self-Sustaining Hosting**: As viewers tip, the incentive program is continuously topped up, which keeps more DIG Nodes (mirrors) hosting the stream. This creates a **self-sustaining system**, where the more popular the stream, the more funding it receives, and the more robust the hosting becomes.

### Resilience: Impossible to Shut Down

A major advantage of this setup is its resilience to censorship or shutdowns. Since the live stream is hosted across a **decentralized network** of peers, it becomes **extremely difficult to take offline**. Here’s why:

1. **Global Distribution of Mirrors**: The stream’s frontend and data are hosted by **DIG Nodes** across multiple jurisdictions worldwide. Even if a mirror is taken down in one location, others will continue to host the stream.

2. **Cat-and-Mouse Dynamic**: As long as viewers continue to tip and fund the incentive program, mirrors will be incentivized to host the stream. If a mirror goes offline, others will step in to fill the gap, creating a game of **cat and mouse**, where it's impossible to shut down all mirrors at once.

3. **Minimal Hosting Requirement**: For the stream to remain accessible, only **one mirror** in the world needs to be hosting the data associated with the UDI. This means the stream is extremely resilient, as it’s unlikely that all mirrors can be shut down at the same time.

### Viewer Tips Ensure Continuous Access

The tipping system plays a critical role in ensuring the **permanence** of the live stream:

- **Incentive for Mirrors**: The tips fund the incentive program, which directly compensates DIG Nodes for mirroring and hosting the live stream’s data. As long as tips flow into the program, the stream remains hosted.

- **Hundreds of Mirrors**: With consistent tipping, the incentive program can fund **hundreds of mirrors** across the world, making the live stream even more resilient to censorship attempts.

- **Multiple Jurisdictions**: With mirrors spread across different jurisdictions, it becomes nearly impossible for any centralized authority to shut down the stream globally.

### Building an Unstoppable Live Stream or Podcast

By combining the **DIG Network**'s decentralized infrastructure with peer-to-peer live streaming technology, creators can build **unstoppable broadcasts** that are highly resilient to takedowns:

- **Permanent UDI**: The stream is always accessible through the **Universal DataLayer Identifier (UDI)**, ensuring that it can be found from a consistent, unchanging location, even as mirrors come and go.

- **Tip-Supported Hosting**: Viewer tips not only support the streamer financially but also **fund the decentralized hosting** of the stream via the DIG Network’s incentive program.

- **Resilient to Censorship**: The global distribution of DIG Nodes ensures that the stream is highly resistant to censorship. Even if some mirrors are shut down, others will step in to keep the stream online.

### Key Takeaways

- **Decentralized Hosting**: The live stream or podcast’s frontend is mounted on the DIG Network and tied to a **Universal DataLayer Identifier (UDI)**, providing a permanent, decentralized location where it can always be accessed.
  
- **Viewer-Funded Incentive Program**: Viewer tips fund the incentive program that compensates DIG Nodes to host the stream, ensuring **self-sustaining hosting**.

- **Impossible to Shut Down**: With mirrors distributed across the world, the stream becomes nearly impossible to take offline, as long as the incentive program continues to be funded by viewers.

This decentralized approach ensures that live streams and podcasts can remain online, resilient to censorship and shutdowns. By using the DIG Network to provide a **permanent UDI**, creators can ensure their broadcasts are always accessible, backed by a global network of peers funded by viewer tips. This creates a powerful, unstoppable platform for creators to broadcast to the world.
