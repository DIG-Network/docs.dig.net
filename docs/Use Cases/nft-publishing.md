# NFT Data Permanence

A major weakness in today's NFT ecosystem is the **lack of guaranteed data permanence**. While ownership of NFTs is secured on-chain, the actual data—like images and metadata—are often hosted on centralized servers. When these servers go offline, NFT collections can degrade into **broken links** or inaccessible content, leaving collectors with tokens that no longer point to anything valuable.

However, by utilizing **on-chain enforced royalties** on the **Chia blockchain**, combined with the decentralized hosting capabilities of the **DIG Network**, we can create a sustainable, long-term solution that ensures **NFT data remains permanently available**.

### The Power of Chia's On-Chain Royalties

On the Chia blockchain, **NFT royalties are enforced on-chain**, meaning a portion of every secondary sale is automatically paid to a **designated royalty address**. This mechanism is immutable and guarantees that creators, or whoever controls the royalty address, consistently receive a portion of each trade, without the need for intermediaries.

### Funding Perpetual Data Hosting

By setting the NFT's **royalty address** to a **wallet that funds a DIG Network incentive program**, we can ensure that the royalties generated from every trade are used to pay **DIG Nodes** (mirrors) to host and propagate the **DataStore** that holds the NFT’s data.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Mint NFTs with a Royalty Address**: When the NFT is created, the royalty address is set to a wallet specifically designated for funding a **DIG Incentive Program**.
   
2. **Royalties Fund Data Hosting**: Every time the NFT is traded, a portion of the sale is automatically sent to the royalty wallet. These funds are used to **pay DIG Nodes** to mirror and host the DataStore containing the NFT’s data (such as images, metadata, etc.).

3. **Continuous Hosting**: As long as the NFT is traded on secondary markets, the royalties will keep the incentive wallet funded, ensuring that mirrors are compensated for keeping the data online and accessible.

### Solving the Problem of NFT Data Loss

This approach guarantees that the NFT's data is **permanently available** from a single resource identifier (such as a URL or hash) because:

- **Decentralized Hosting**: The NFT’s data is hosted by multiple **DIG Nodes** across a decentralized network, removing any reliance on centralized servers.
  
- **Perpetual Funding**: As long as the NFT collection is traded, the royalties continue to fund the mirrors, ensuring indefinite availability of the data.

- **Immutable Resource**: The data remains accessible from the same identifier, preventing the issue of broken links or disappearing content that plagues many NFT collections today.

### A Self-Sustaining NFT Ecosystem

By leveraging Chia’s on-chain royalties to fund decentralized hosting, this model creates a **self-sustaining system** where NFT collections can exist **indefinitely** without the risk of data becoming inaccessible. This ensures that NFTs are not just tokens on a blockchain but are backed by **permanent, accessible data**.

### Conclusion

This method solves a critical issue in the NFT space: **data permanence**. By using **Chia’s perpetual royalties** to fund mirrors on the **DIG Network**, NFT data can remain **online and accessible** for years to come. This approach transforms NFTs from fragile digital artifacts into **reliable, permanent assets**, ensuring that collectors and creators alike can trust in the long-term availability of their digital creations.
